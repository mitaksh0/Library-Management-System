# Library Management System API

This is a Django-based API for managing a library system with authors, books, borrow records, and reports. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on authors and books, create borrow records, and generate reports using background tasks.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Authors
- **GET /authors/**:  
  List all authors.

- **POST /authors/**:  
  Create a new author.

- **GET /authors/<id>/**:  
  Retrieve a specific author by ID.

- **PUT /authors/<id>/**:  
  Update a specific author by ID.

- **DELETE /authors/<id>/**:  
  Delete a specific author by ID.

### 2. Books
- **GET /books/**:  
  List all books.

- **POST /books/**:  
  Add a new book.

- **GET /books/<id>/**:  
  Retrieve a specific book by ID.

- **PUT /books/<id>/**:  
  Update a specific book by ID.

- **DELETE /books/<id>/**:

### 3. Borrow Records
- **POST /borrow/**:  
  Create a new borrow record. The available copies of the book are reduced by 1 if copies are available.

- **PUT /borrow/<id>/return/**:  
  Mark a book as returned. This sets the return date and increases the available copies by 1.

### 4. Reports
